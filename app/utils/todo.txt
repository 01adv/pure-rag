in analyze query:

in the first statement if the user query is missing in category: skin toner etc
or a skin concern / skin type : mark for follow up

follow up question:
include examples for follow from pure prompt


>> include a logic : if you have hit one follow up question >> either have enough information then recommend >> else ask another follow and show recomm
try limiting the follow up to 1 ques  >> to calculate enough info, check for skin details and type,  gather details, avoid redundant info


>> re rank the doc without llm instead directly with embeddings

>> with latest llms we can remove this transformation of user query 

>> remove additional data eg: support stuff inlude reviews in csv`
